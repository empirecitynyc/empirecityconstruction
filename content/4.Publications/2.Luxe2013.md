## Living Room

Citrine accents in a custom Mastour Galleries carpet and a lacquered parchment tabletop by Etched Design add bright color to the gray palette. Schumacher fabrics—silk velvet on Hickory Chair’s Silhouettes sofa and Gainsborough lilac velvet on tufted chairs by Design Quest Custom—encourage lounging. Right: The original fireplace and paneled walls were given new life by Empire City Construction.

## Kitchen

Empire City Construction revamped cabinetry in the kitchen and mixed a custom floor stain. Heidi Bianco of Kemble Interiors designed the new range hood, fabricated by Work and Design in Brooklyn. The 1970s Lucite stools, from Red Modern Furniture in Phoenix, add glamour. Globe pendants are by Arteriors.

## Dining

A teak buffet from Sabina Danenberg Antiques in Miami anchors the dining room. Above it are a vintage mirror from Liz O’Brien and Gaetano Sciolari sconces purchased through 1stdibs. Oly chairs with Moore & Giles teal leather surround a glass-topped table with a labradorite base from Remi Danielle Design in West Palm Beach.

## Study

The study’s Alexander sofa from Patagonia Home in Los Angeles, covered in a Pindler & Pindler herringbone, echoes the midnight blue theme, which also repeats on a leather Century Furniture desk chair. Philippine artist Lao Lian Ben’s painting and the Michaelian & Kohlberg carpet were the clients’ own.

## Master Bedroom

In the niche by a master bed dressed in Cristina Azario linens is a Dorothy Draper-style dresser from Circa Who in West Palm Beach, above which hangs a mirror from GO Home Ltd. Overhead, a chandelier from Made Goods adds reflective pizzazz.
